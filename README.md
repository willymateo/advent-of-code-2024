Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This project contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges, organized by day. Each folder represents a specific day and contains the input data and Python scripts for solving both parts of the challenge.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each day's folder follows this structure:

```
dayX/
  ├── data.txt         # Input data for the challenge
  ├── part-1.py        # Solution for Part 1
  └── part-2.py        # Solution for Part 2
```

## 🐍 Setting Up the Environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the solutions, you will need to have Python installed on your system and create a virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Code

To run the solutions, navigate to the corresponding day folder and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd dayX/
python part-1.py
python part-2.py
```

Happy coding! 🎅✨
